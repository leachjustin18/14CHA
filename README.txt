I created a web page that has flash that interacts with JavaScript. The flash animation waits for a call from JavaScript/jQuery to show a specific action/movie from the flash file.  The function is activated by selecting one of the 5 buttons. When clicked, a function will fire, grab alt tag from that image, show related information for that button number and activate the part of the flash movie.  Coded it where all the images will be cached when the page loads to help improve speed of images showing up. When hovering over images it will also show a hover state of them. This is done by listening for a hover state. When hovering over an image it will pull the rel tag in, which has the other image, replace the src tag with the image, and then when you hover out of it; it will put the hover image back into rel, and show the original image. During hovering the original image is stored in the rel tag.  When compare is clicked it will activate jQuery animation and slide the box to the left out to the right, covering the text to the left, and fade in a comparison image. When return is compared it will make the box shrink back to its original width and show the flash movie again.
